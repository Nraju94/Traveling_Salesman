# Travelling Salesman Problem - Algorithm

WGU Parcel Service uses a travelling salesman problem (TSP) approximation approach to optimise packet transport routes. Multiple transport vehicles are supported, as are real-time modifications to transport schedules and addresses, and full status updates for each packet are provided at any time before, during, or after transport.

Includes a full description and analysis of the program's instance and space complexity.
